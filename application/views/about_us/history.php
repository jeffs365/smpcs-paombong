						<span>During the incumbency of the late Rev. Msgr. Juan Sumera,  Parish Priest of St. James the Apostle, Paombong, Bulacan, he founded a Catechetical School named Escuela de la Immaculada Concepcion.  The date of foundation is unknown because its records were lost in the floods that hit in Paombong and many towns in Central Luzon in 1970’s.  The remaining documents, however,  reveal that from the Catechetical School evolved the Paombong, Catholic School which offered formal education.</span>
						<br>

						<span>The existing historical data from the documents of Paombong, Catholic School was the Government Recognition for General Intermediate Course (No. 29, series of 1933) which was issued on March 6, 1933 effective June 1933, from the Government of the Philippine Islands-Department of Public Instruction.  Then a series of Permit and Renewal of Permit to open and conduct complete Elementary Course and Kindergarten Course started 1942 to 1945.  Finally in 1946, Paombong, Catholic School received the Government Recognition for both the Elementary and Kindergarten Courses.  During its early years of existence,  Paombong Catholic School was subsidized by the Obra Pias of the Archdiocese of Manila because at this point in time,  the Diocese of Malolos was not established yet.  With the said subsidy, the School was able to offer free education, school supplies and weekly ration of powdered milk and wheat.  The standard of education however, decreased in quality because of discontented teachers who perceived that the  people took free education for granted.  When the Obras Pias of the Archdiocese of Manila had stopped subsidizing  the school, an old association in the parish called Confraternity of Our Lady of Consolation also known as Nuestra Senora de Correa helped in subsidizing the institution.</span>

						<span>In 1966, the Diocese of Malolos was canonically established.  It’s first Bishop, Most Rev. Fr. Manuel del Rosario, D.D., invited the Dominican Sisters of St. Joseph (then called Secular Institute of St. Dominic) to have the full administration of the School.  To upgrade the teachers’ salaries, the Sisters introduced the payment of one peso 
tuition fee a month per pupil.  To make the people co-responsible for the education of their children and to raise the standard of the school, the pupils’ tuition was gradually increased to three pesos per month.  Later however, the same minimal fee was no longer enough to meet the partial subsidy of the Parish Confraternity of Our Lady of Consolation, thus the school had to apply for a gradual increase of tuition and other fees.

						<span>During the school year 1967-1968 the Sisters applied for a change of name of the school and this  was approved by the Ministry of Education during that school year. Henceforth,  the story of the St. Martin de Porres Catholic School started to unfold.  St. Martin de Porres, the Patron Saint of the School is found to be a lover of all classes of people but he has special love for the poor and the needy.  His  shining virtues: charitable, humble and simple paved the way for the excellent teachers to continue serving their pupils wholeheartedly.  The Sisters, together with the teachers, inculcate in the minds and hearts of their pupils love for God and their neighbor.  Hand in hand they continue forming those young minds in helping not only their own families but also the unfortunate ones in the neighborhood.  The teachers continued to serve inspite of their low salaries out of love for teaching and love for their pupils.  Subsidy from the Diocese has stopped but through the collaborative efforts of the Sisters, teachers and parents, the School continues to survive fulfilling its mission of providing quality integral education and formation.</span>
